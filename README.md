# CS_Project
This is the computer applications group project for the year 2023-2024 hosted on Github. The basic function of the program is to act as a simple bank.
It has the ability to calculate the interest to be paid for various different types of loans and various deposits (Recurring Deposit and Fixed Deposit).
I am currently in the process of adding a loop to allow it to be rerun without having to re-execute the file.

### **All changes have to be made first to [experimental](https://github.com/Apple-User-163/CS_Project/tree/experimental) then pushed to [main](https://github.com/Apple-User-163/CS_Project/tree/main). This includes updating [README.md](https://github.com/Apple-User-163/CS_Project/blob/main/README.md)**
