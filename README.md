# CS_Project
This is the computer applications group project for the year 2023-2024 hosted on Github. The basic function of the program is to act as a simple bank.
It has the ability to calaculate the interest to be pad for vaious different types of loans and various deposits (Recurring Deposit and Fixed Deposit).
I am currently in the process of adding a loop to allow it to be rerun without having to re-execute the file.

### **All changes have to be made first to the 'experimental' branch then pushed to 'main'. This includes updating the 'README.md' file**
