# CS_Project
This is the computer science group project for the year 2023-2024 hosted on github. The basic function of the program is to act as a simple bank.
It has the ability to calaculate the interest to be pad for vaious different types of loans and various deposits (Recurring Deposit and Fixed Deposit).
I am currently in the process of adding a loop to allow it to be rerun without having to re-execute the file.
All changes will fist be made to the 'experimental' branch.
